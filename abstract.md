## Abstract
1. **Problem definition/importanceï¼š** Decentralized proactive transshipment is **more common** than centralized transshipment in practical scenarios, but **rarely studied** due to the complexity of the problem. We apply MADRL to this problem and see if it can achieve outstanding performance. We also examine whether information sharing and centralization are significantly effective. 
2. **Methodology:** We apply Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) on this problem by generating **joint ordering and transshipment polices.** 
3. Results: lower overall costs than other heuristics
